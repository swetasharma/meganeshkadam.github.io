We are building MindSphere (IIoT(Industrial Internet of things) platform) 
which uses SAP HANA cloud platform(It is an open platform-as-a-service).
Currently We are using SAP HANA for building services and to deploy.
SAP HANA cloud platform provides Cloud Foundry as a service.In future we planning to use AWS





Sweta Sharma Working as a software engineer for last4 years in various organizations including startups, 
I have experience in popular cloud platforms AWS Iaas, Pivotal Cloud Foundry PaaS platform. I take great interest 
in learning and sharing my knowledge on newer technologoes. During leisure i enjoy good soothing music. I believe
sharing knowledge is my way to make this world a better place. 


Introduction to CloudFoundry:

Runtime componennt: instances of your applicatuion runnungs scaling them up or down serving http traffic

cloud foundry bosh component: deployment and configuration layer and services layer

install cfgem - command line interface for cloud foundry from where you can push your applicaiton
cloud controller: keeps track of desired state of worls is :
it keeps track of applicatrion code. application version how many instances you wan t 
respomsible for upgrading application when you push new code to it

here are all the files that make up the application ckoud controller will take the chekcsums of all the files and say i hav ethese files and  i dont hav e\
these files send me the differenceyou dont enbd up sending up entire application to cloud foundry every time  you just up the docker to cloud controller
cloud controller then stores in blob store and once it has received all the files will start deploying your app 
challenge we have here is that as a developer you tend to only package the code that you need in you application 
you dont package all the libraries that you need 
take your source bits an dtransform it into something w can run on cloud foundry 
staging is where we take code and run build packer on it 
build packer will look at  your code if it is a ruby app it will install all the ruby gems
if is a java app iyt will take your code/jar a ndthen it will download the jre and package that up withit it will also package some auto configuration logic 
library so you dont have to know how to  connect to various services in cloud foundry by the end of this staging process we end up with tar it will start 
running your application and serving.
At this point we dont at what framework your applicaiton is we dont need to depend upon what runtime dependencies your application will have it gives all us into the\
droplet we take that droplet first thingwe do is tha uploading that droplet back to the cloud controller at same time it starts one copy of your app
your app will run at four different instances at sime for reliability in case if instance failure

Heallt mamager : kill the old version and start the new version

Log aggregation

Cloud Foundry BOSH
Cloud Foundry services you take stateless runtime layer and state to it. 
its great to be able to push an app but it does not wok well untill youy have some sort of stateful layer behind it usually it is relational database
it could be somthoing like redis it could be momgo it could be cassandra that you wanna  bind your appliactions

cloud foundry services are the way that you can enable that
